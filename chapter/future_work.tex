The strength of our multi-label image tagging architecture depends on convolutional neural network classifier and the method for segmenting images.So, be refining out convolutional neural network to include more labels by training CIFAR-100 and using better methods to segment the image, we can improve the performance of the network.As the image segmentation techniques give duplicate segmented images, so to sort out all the unique segmented images can be a nice challenge to achieve.
